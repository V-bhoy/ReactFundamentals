What is error ?
It is an abnormal event that occurs at runtime and abrupt the normal flow of the program

Types:
1. Syntax error ===> occurs when there is invalid syntax in the code
ex. const x;

2. Reference error ==> occurs when we try to access a reference that is not present in the memory or is out of scope
ex. console.log(a); a does not exist

3. Type error ==> occurs when an operation is performed on incompatible type
ex. let a = "hello" * 2;

You can manually throw error by passing value/string/object
ex. throw new Error("I am an error"); You create an instance of Error or subclass of it

can be handled using -
1. try-catch block
2. try-catch-finally block

try-catch cannot handle following errors
1. syntax
2. stack overflow
3. memory leaks
