 * React = the core library through which we can create components and build our UI in more
 structured and organized manner.
 * React-DOM = it's the React library that acts a bridge between the DOM tree and the React components.
               It provides apis to render our React components into the DOM tree

What is a React element ?
- smallest building block in a React application that describes UI.
- it is not the actual DOM node.
- it's a plain object that describes the DOM node / component to render
- tâ€™s immutable (unchangeable once created).

To create a React element ==>
React.createElement(tagName, attributes, children)
attributes --> object where we can define attributes to our html element
children --> the content within the html element, if it is a single child, you can pass the
             React element directly, otherwise you need to pass an array.
when you console log this React element -> it contains
1. type ==> tag name
2. props ==> {children, ...attributes}


To render react elements into the actual DOM,
React needs a root container within which it will render all the React elements.
To define the root we use,
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
This method creates the root container where we pass the target node in our actual DOM as the argument.
To render the React element, we use render() on root which takes react element as parameter;
const heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello"); // react element)
root.render(heading);
It takes the javascript object, converts it to browser understandable node element
This will inject the node element into the actual DOM

What is npm?
npm does not stand for node package manager.
But it is a standard repository where all the packages and libraries are hosted, which we can import
in our application and npm manages those libraries in our application.
Let's have npm in our app!

cmd => npm init
asks few things to configure
once we configure those properties, it creates package.json in your file.

package.json? it is configuration for npm
